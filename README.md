### Streamlit Application for EDA-IDA Processes

[Open in Streamlit](https://jiawei-0813-cmse830-streamlit-app-sy5uoy.streamlit.app/)

This project features a Streamlit application that visualizes two datasets:

- **London Bike-Share Usage Dataset**: This dataset includes bicycle journeys from Transport for London (TfL) for August 2023.
- **Open-Meteo Weather Data**: This data was obtained from the Open-Meteo API, providing weather information for the same period.

Users can explore trends and gain insights through interactive charts and graphs. The main goal of the application is to help users better understand these datasets and make data-driven decisions based on the visualizations.

This repository includes all the materials I submitted for my midterm project, which was developed as part of the data science course.
